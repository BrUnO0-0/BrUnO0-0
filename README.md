<p align="left"> Hello! Bruno aqui. Back-end Devoloper, Itapetininga-SP, Brazil.
  
I'm in a career transition, I've already studied 2 years of (***Industrial Production Management - Technologist***) and I came across a cool project, where we would have to create our own product, this was the first contact I had with Technology where all the work was developed by **Arduino-C++**. At first glance, all those codes, it was so cool to develop for the project, and you know, I had already lost the sparkle in my college eyes. Then, this year 2023 was where I started my graduation ***Software Engineer***, and we're going to the end.
